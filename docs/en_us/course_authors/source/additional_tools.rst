Additional Tools Overview
*************************

Individual course teams frequently create tools and problem types that don't have templates in Studio. We want to make these tools available to all our course teams. 

Below, we provide you with all the files and code that you need to create the following tools and problem types.

* :ref:`Chemical Equation`
* :ref:`Interactive Periodic Table`
* :ref:`Molecule Editor`
* :ref:`Multiple Choice and Numerical Input`
* :ref:`Protein Builder`

.. _Chemical Equation:

**************************
Chemical Equation Problem
**************************

The chemical equation problem type allows the student to enter chemical equations. The grader evaluates student responses by using a Python script that you create and embed in the problem.

Chemical Equation Problem Code
====================================

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <startouttext/>
    <p>Some problems may ask for a particular chemical equation. Practice by writing out the following reaction in the box below.</p>
    
  \( \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \longrightarrow \text { H}^+ + \text{ HSO}_4^-\)

      <answer type="loncapa/python">

  if chemcalc.chemical_equations_equal(submission[0], 'H2SO4 -> H^+ + HSO4^-'):
      correct = ['correct']
  else:
      correct = ['incorrect']

      </answer>
    </customresponse>
    <p>Some tips:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Use real element symbols.</li>
    <li>Create subscripts by using plain text.</li>
    <li>Create superscripts by using a caret (^).</li>
    <li>Create the reaction arrow (\(\longrightarrow\)) by using "->".</li>
    </ul>

   <p>To create this equation, enter the following:</p>
     <p>H2SO4 -> H^+ + HSO4^-</p>
   </div>
   </solution>
  </problem>

.. _Interactive Periodic Table:

**************************
Interactive Periodic Table
**************************

You can create an interactive periodic table of the elements to help your students learn about various elements' properties. In the table below, detailed information about each element appears as the student moves the mouse over the element.

.. image:: /Images/Periodic_Table.gif

.. _Create the Periodic Table:

==========================
Create the Periodic Table
==========================

To create a periodic table, you need the following files:

* Periodic-Table.js
* Periodic-Table.css
* Periodic-Table-Colors.css
* PeriodicTableHTML.txt

To download all of these files in a .zip archive, click http://files.edx.org/PeriodicTableFiles.zip. 

To create the periodic table, you need an HTML component.

#. Upload all of the files listed above *except PeriodicTable.txt* to the **Files & Uploads** page in your course.
#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, click **HTML** under **Add New Component**, and then click **HTML**.
#. In the component that appears, click **Edit**.
#. In the component editor, switch to the **HTML** tab.
#. Open the PeriodicTable.txt file in any text editor.
#. Copy all of the text in the PeriodicTable.txt file, and paste it into the HTML component editor. (Note that the PeriodicTableHTML.txt file contains over 6000 lines of code. Paste all of this code into the component editor.)
#. Click **Save**.

.. _Molecule Editor:

************************
Molecule Editor
************************

Students can use the molecule editor to learn how to create molecules. The molecule editor allows students to draw molecules that follow the rules for covalent bond formation and formal charge, but are chemically impossible. The molecule editor warns students if they try to submit a structure that is not possible.

.. image:: /Images/Molecule_Editor.gif
  :alt: Image of the molecule editor

.. _Create the Molecule Editor:

==========================
Create the Molecule Editor
==========================

To create a molecule editor, you need the following files:

* Molecules_Dopamine.mol
* MoleculeAnswer.png
* MoleculeEditor_HTML.png

To download all of these files in a .zip archive, go to http://files.edx.org/MoleculeEditorFiles.zip.

To create the molecule editor, you need an HTML component followed by a Problem component.

#. Upload all of the files listed above to the **Files & Uploads** page in your course.
#. Create the HTML component.
  #. In the unit where you want to create the problem, click **HTML** under **Add New Component**, and then click **HTML**.
  #. In the component that appears, click **Edit**.
  #. In the component editor, paste the HTML component code from below.

  <p>The chemical editor you are using ensures that the structures you draw are correct in one very narrow sense, that they follow the rules for covalent bond formation and formal charge. However, there are many structures that follow these rules that are chemically impossible, unstable, do not exist in living systems, or are beyond the scope of this course. The editor will let you draw them because, in contrast to the rules of formal charge, these properties cannot be easily and reliably predicted from structures.</p>
  <p>If you submit a structure that includes atoms that are not possible or are beyond the scope of this course, the software will warn you specifically about these parts of your structure and you will be allowed to edit your structure and re-submit. Submitting an improper structure will not count as one of your tries. In general, you should try to use only the atoms most commonly cited in this course: C, H, N, O, P, and S. If you want to learn about formal charge, you can play around with other atoms and unusual configurations and look at the structures that result.</p>

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
      <p>The protein builder allows you string together the building blocks of proteins, amino acids, and see how that string will form into a structure. You are presented with a goal protein shape, and your task is to try to re-create it. In the example below, the shape that you are asked to form is a simple line.</p> 

      <script type="loncapa/python">

  def two_d_grader(expect,ans):
    import json
    ans=json.loads(ans)
    if "ERROR" in ans["protex_answer"]:
      raise ValueError("Protex did not understand your answer... try folding the protein")
    return ans["protex_answer"]=="CORRECT"

    <p>Be sure to click "Fold" to fold your protein before you click "Check".</p>
    <solution>
      <p>
              There are many protein sequences that will fold to the shape we asked you
              about. Here is a sample sequence that will work. You can play around with
              it if you are curious.
