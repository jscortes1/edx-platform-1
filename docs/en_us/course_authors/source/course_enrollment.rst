For the enrollment period that is defined for a course, enrollment in an edX course (on www.edx.org) is publicly available to anyone who registers an edX account. Enrollment in an Edge course (on edge.edx.org) is limited to a defined group: students who you give the course URL to, and students who you enroll. 

**Question**: is the above accurate?

Course authors and instructors can enroll students in a course, see how many people are enrolled, and, when necessary, unenroll students.

*********************************
Registration and Enrollment
*********************************

Before a student can be enrolled in a course, he or she must:

#. Register a user account, which includes supplying a valid email address, on `www.edx.org` or `edge.edx.org`.

#. Follow the emailed instructions to activate the registered account.

#. Students can then enroll themselves in any edx.org course, and can enroll in an Edge course if they know its URL.

For a more detailed description of this process from a student's point of view, see :ref:`APPENDIX C: Sample Student Login Guide`. 

Course authors and instructors can enroll students in a course either before or after they register their user accounts. You enroll students in a course by entering their email addresses. When you enroll students, you have options to:

* Auto enroll. This option enrolls any student who already has a registered user account in the course immediately. Students who have not registered are enrolled as soon as they do register and activate a user account for that email address. As a result, students do not need to perform the explicit enrollment step.

* Notify students by email. The email message includes the name of the course, a link to the registration page, and a reminder to use the email address that you supplied for the student.
