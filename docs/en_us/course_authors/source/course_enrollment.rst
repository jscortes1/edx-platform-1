Course authors and instructors can enroll students in a course, see how many people are enrolled, and, when necessary, unenroll students.

For the enrollment period that is defined for a course, enrollment in an edX course (on www.edx.org) is publicly available to anyone who registers an edX account. Enrollment in other courses, such as those on edge.edx.org, is limited to the group of students you give the course URL to, and students that you enroll. 

**Question**: is the above accurate?

*********************************
Registration and Enrollment
*********************************

Before a student can be enrolled in a course, he or she must:

#. Register a user account, which includes supplying a valid email address, on `www.edx.org`, `edge.edx.org`, or your implementation of the edX platform.

#. Activate the registered account by following the emailed instructions.

Students can then enroll themselves in any edx.org course, and can enroll in other courses if they know the URL. For a more detailed description of this process from a student's point of view, see :ref:`APPENDIX C: Sample Student Login Guide`. 

Course authors and instructors can enroll students in a course either before or after they register their user accounts. You enroll students in a course by entering email addresses. When you enroll students, you have options to:

* Auto enroll. Enrolls any student who already has a registered user account in the course immediately. Students who are not registered are enrolled as soon as they do register and activate a user account for the same email address. As a result, students do not need to perform the explicit course enrollment step.

* Notify students by email. The email message includes the name of the course, a link to the registration page, and a reminder to use the email address that you supplied for the student.

* In addition to students, the enrollment count includes the course author, course team members, instructors, and course staff. (In order to work with a course, you must be enrolled in it.)

* Students can unenroll from courses, and course authors and instructors can unenroll students when necessary. The enrollment count is for currently enrolled students, and does not include historically enrolled students.
