Staffing
##########################

You can designate a team of people to help you run your course. Two roles are available to provide different levels of access to options for working with students, grading, and other course staff.

* Staff members

* Instructors

**Question**: how does this team, set up on the Instructor Dashboard, differ from the "Course Team Members" that you add in Studio (Settings > Course Team)?

You can also designate people to help you beta test a course, and to moderate and manage discussions. For more information, see :ref:`Beta_Testing` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`. 

**********************

To give different levels of access to LMS features, you assign the Course Staff role or the Instructor role.

**Course Staff** can:

* Enroll and unenroll students.

* Access student grades.

* Reset student attempts to answer a question correctly.

* See course HTML errors.

**Instructors** have access to all of the same options for running the course as the course staff. They can also:

* Add and remove course staff.

* Add and remove other instructors.

* Add and remove beta testers.

* Add and remove discussion forum admins, moderators, and community TAs.

**********************
Assign staff roles

Before you can assign the course staff or instructor role to a team member:

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Click **Instructor** then **Try New Beta Dashboard**.

#. Click **Membership**.

#. In the Administration List Management section, use the drop-down list to select Course Staff or Instructors.

#. Under the list of users who currently have that role, enter an email address and click **Add** for the role type.

#. To remove an assigned role, view the list of users and then click revoke access (the **X**) next to that email address.
